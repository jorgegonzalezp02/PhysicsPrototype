Code and experience requirements
-**Continuous and descrete inputs from player**: The player will constantly use the mouse to click and the keyboard arrows to move the character.

-**Player achieving goal indirectly (with the physics engine)**: The player will have access to the mouse and keyboard to play the demo. The player will be allowed to jump and move side to side. If for some reason they get stuck on a level, then they can click on the top left corner arrow to restart the level/scene. They will also collect gems throughout some of the levels. When coming in contact with an arrow or a sprite such as the sword from Scene 5, they will move onto the next scene. 

-**+3 physics-based scenes**: The scenes that include physics such as collisions, player movement, gravity, and scene transitions are Scene 1, Scene 3, and Scene 5.

-**Other scenes used to contextualize the gameplay scenes**: Other scenes that were implemented into the game were summary scenes such as a loading screen that displays messages, a display of points and items collected with a button to proceed to the next scene, and a custom "new weapon achieved" scene that has an animation and a button to go to the next scene.
